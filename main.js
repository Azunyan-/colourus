function printCategories {
    //Import json
    //loop trough each ul and write out the contents of it including which cat it is
    //Suggest that we also directly style the category colours via the html which is written via this function and not the already prewritten css.
    //If a list item has a colour and a hex write a style="" with that inside it for that list item so that each indivdual list item can actually be colour if the user so desires
